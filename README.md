# Toxicity-Prediction-GNN-

Hello! This is my GNN Molecular Toxicity Predictor. I used a GAT framework and some help from Hosein Fooladi to help create this! I was able to achieve a ROC-AUC score of 0.8021!

Future goals: Improve ROC-AUC goal, try building the entire GAT from barebones, incorporate more data sets (only have Tox21)
